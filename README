CS488 assignment 4

Compilation:
normal premake4/make within current directory (A3)
assignment completed on linux student environment (MC 3007)

Manual:
A4_Render calls traceColor for each image pixel
traceColor calls rayInterceptScene on the scene root node which checks for intersection on itself
	and recursively for its children
The primatives subclasses do the heavy lifting for individual ray collision
	and the GeometryNode does some validity checking on the primitive's result.

screenshot.png contains the render from sample.lua "Cows staring into the abyss"

Extention:
The traceColor function is modified to accept a reflectDepth value.
On each call traceColor will "modify" the perceived color by reflecting another ray off the intercepted surface and combining the two found colours.
(this continues recursively for a set dept)
The colours are combined as a fraction of the material shininess
(perhaps a seperate reflectiveness value should be added to the materials, but shininess and reflectiveness are closely related)
